# Migration Plan: Transitioning to Cursor

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for migrating our financial intelligence platform from its current state to Cursor.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Dependencies
1. Set up Cursor development environment
   - Install required system dependencies
   - Configure Python environment
   - Set up Node.js for frontend components

2. Dependencies Migration
   ```toml
   [tool.poetry]
   name = "financial-intelligence-platform"
   version = "0.1.0"
   
   [tool.poetry.dependencies]
   python = "^3.11"
   streamlit = "*"
   pandas = "*"
   numpy = "*"
   scikit-learn = "*"
   tensorflow = "*"
   sentence-transformers = "*"
   faiss-cpu = "*"
   plotly = "*"
   ```

## Phase 2: Database Migration
1. Create database migration scripts
2. Set up new database schema in Cursor
3. Data validation and integrity checks
4. Rollback procedures

## Phase 3: Code Migration

### Backend Changes
1. Update service layer
   - Modify trading signal service
   - Update volume analysis components
   - Adapt ML models for new environment

2. API Modifications
   - Update endpoints for Cursor compatibility
   - Implement new error handling
   - Add request validation

### Frontend Updates
1. Streamlit component migration
2. Update visualization components
3. Implement new UI features

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. Performance testing
4. User acceptance testing

## Migration Checklist
- [ ] Environment setup complete
- [ ] Dependencies migrated
- [ ] Database migration scripts created
- [ ] Backend services updated
- [ ] Frontend components migrated
- [ ] Tests implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Rollback Plan
In case of migration issues:
1. Database rollback procedures
2. Code versioning rollback
3. Environment restoration steps

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks

Total estimated time: 8 weeks

## Technical Considerations
1. Data persistence and state management
2. API compatibility
3. Performance optimization
4. Security implementations

## Risk Mitigation
1. Regular backups
2. Staged migration approach
3. Continuous testing
4. User communication plan
