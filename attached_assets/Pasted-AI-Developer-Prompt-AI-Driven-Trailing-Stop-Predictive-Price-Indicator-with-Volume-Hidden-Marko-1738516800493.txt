AI Developer Prompt: AI-Driven Trailing Stop & Predictive Price Indicator with Volume & Hidden Markov Models
Objective:
Develop an AI-enhanced trailing stop order system that dynamically adjusts based on volume effects and Hidden Markov Chains. The system should predict trend reversals, accumulation/distribution phases, and institutional buying/selling patterns. It should also integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI to correlate volume shifts with earnings reports, SEC filings, and macroeconomic news.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features & Implementation Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Intelligent Trailing Stop Order System
‚úÖ Implement adaptive trailing stop orders based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and volume dynamics.
‚úÖ Enable real-time adjustments using Markov state transitions to prevent premature stop-outs.
‚úÖ Optimize order execution by incorporating AI-driven predictive price movements.

Implementation Details:
Define market regimes using HMMs to classify bull/bear/consolidation phases.
Adjust trailing stop distance dynamically based on volume-weighted price impact.
Use AI-based sentiment extraction to detect news-driven price shocks before trailing stop updates.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Volume-Based Predictive Price Indicator
‚úÖ Train an LSTM + Markov Chain hybrid model to forecast price shifts based on volume changes.
‚úÖ Extract volume patterns that signal breakouts, fakeouts, and institutional moves.
‚úÖ Incorporate RAG AI to analyze SEC filings & earnings reports for additional insights.

Implementation Details:
Fetch real-time Alpha Vantage OHLCV data and store it in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) & BigQuery.
Use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to predict volume-driven price movement probabilities.
Fine-tune trailing stop orders based on AI-predicted volatility changes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Market Intelligence Layer
‚úÖ Implement context-aware AI to explain why volume shifts occur.
‚úÖ Use RAG-powered AI to correlate volume spikes with earnings, economic data, and news sentiment.
‚úÖ Generate actionable insights for traders by merging quantitative analysis with AI-generated narratives.

Implementation Details:
Retrieve earnings & news sentiment from SEC EDGAR & OpenAI embeddings.
Match high-volume price moves to AI-extracted fundamental insights.
Expose AI-generated trading signals via a FastAPI backend.
